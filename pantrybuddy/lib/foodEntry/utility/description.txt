Different methods of food entry into the inventory/pantry:

1) The user can scan the barcode of a food product to retrieve
 the UPC code, which is then passed to Spoonacular's "Search Grocery
  Products by UPC" endpoint which returns a GroceryItem object  
  and updates the list of GroceryItems in the user's pantry via 
  the Firebase Realtime database. In the creation of the GroceryItem object,
   the user will have to specify / manually input the expiration date 
   listed on the product. 

2) The user can perform an autocomplete search of ingredients, 
products, and menu items from respective endpoints within Spoonacular. 
This will return a GroceryItem object and updates the list of GroceryItems 
in the user's pantry through the Firebase Realtime database. In the 
creation of the GroceryItem object, the user will have to specify / 
manually input the expiration date listed on the product.  The system 
will suggest a guideline for the expiration date. 

3) The user can manually add a food product to their pantry, 
representing a UI form complete with the required fields for 
creating a GroceryItem object. Upon creation, the list of GroceryItems 
in the user's pantry is updated. In the creation of the GroceryItem 
object, the user will have to specify / manually input the expiration 
date listed on the product. In addition, the user will have to choose 
from among the product categories listed under foodKeeper_categories 
when filling in the category field for the GroceryItem as well as an 
"N/A" option. If the user does not choose N/A, then an additional
 field appears below allowing the user to choose an additional 
 subcategory, listing the Name + Name_Subtitle of all items underneath
  "foodKeeper_expiration" as well as an N/A option. If the user does
   not choose N/A for the subcategory as well, then the system will 
   print a suggested guideline for the expiration date below the field 
   for manual input for expiration date. In this case, the successful 
   match corresponds to whatever item from the expiration CSV the user
   chose.

Utility Function - Expiration Date Guideline Suggestion:
For the autocomplete and manual food entry methods (functions 1 and 2), 
the system suggests an expiration date based on matching the product and/or 
its category to the "foodKeeper_expiration.csv" spreadsheet, you can JOIN 
the two spreadsheets "foodKeeper_expiration.csv" and "foodKeeper_categories.
csv" on ID (within categories csv) / Category_ID (within expiration csv). 
 Upon a successful match, the system will print out "For freshness and 
 quality, this item should be consumed within [DOP_Refrigerate_Max + 
 DOP_Refrigerate_Metric] if refrigerated from the date of purchase" where 
 the fields in the brackets match the columns in the expiration CSV.  If 
 Pantry_Max and Pantry_Metric have values, then you can also print "For 
 freshness and quality, this item should be consumed within [Pantry_Max + 
 Pantry_Metric] if in the pantry from the date of purchase." This will be 
 printed underneath the manual entry for expiration date. If Refrigerate
 _After_Opening_Max and Refrigerate_After_Opening_Metric have values, 
 then you can also print "For freshness and quality, this item should be 
 consumed within [Refrigerate_After_Opening_Max + Refrigerate_After_Opening
 _Metric] if refrigerated after opening"



 MANUAL Entry Widget Specification
 Using the joined list of all food products (foodKeeper.csv), 
 with category ids and category_names that are repeated, there are 2 drop-down menus:

   1. The first drop down list of all the Level 1 categories (defined as Category_Name column, 
   removing duplicates and leading/trailing spaces) as well as the option for N/A. 
   2. The second drop down list appears listing all the Level 2 categories (defined under NAME_all column) 
   for under the specified Level 1 category as well as the option for N/A.

 Under the drop-down menus, there are text fields allowing for manual user input of 
 product name, product category, quantity and a date picker for expiration date (defined through the setExpirationDate function)

 Exceptions:
   - The text field for product category is greyed out if Level 1 category is not N/A
   - If L2 category is not N/A, the user may choose to leave the product name empty

Underneath the date picker for the expiration date is a text box for a suggested guideline
for expiration date (using the suggestExpiration_Manual function). If L2 category is selected,
the system will note the ID of the row (since L2 category functions at the row level), pass
it to the function, then print what it returned in the text box. If N/A is selected for the
L2 category, then the guideline used will be "No specific expiration information available."

Upon successful entry of the product name (L2 or user-specified), product category (L1 or user-specified), 
quantity, and expiration date, the system will create a GroceryItem object.
